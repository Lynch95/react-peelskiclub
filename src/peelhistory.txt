 The Peel Ski Club has its origins in the troubles in Northern Ireland. Police officers from the Metropolitan Police Service formed the club to take on holiday officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary who had been injured in service.
 The first trip took place in 1998 to the ski resort in Spital am Semmering in Austria. Adaptive skiing took place allowing even the most severely injured officers to participate in this life-enhancing sport.
 Each disabled skier has two or three buddies that ski with them throughout the week and care for them as needed. The trip was very successful and as a result, has become a regular biennial event.
 The peace process in Northern Ireland has happily meant fewer officers were being injured in service, and so the club has diversified, taking non-police personnel who were disabled perhaps because of injury or illness.
